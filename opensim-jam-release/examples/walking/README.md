# Example: Walking

## Simulation Description
This example uses the COMAK to predict muscle forces, ligament forces, cartilage contact pressures, and secondary knee kinematics (5 tibiofemoral DOFs, 5 patellofemoral DOFs) during walking. 

The experimental data (motion capture, ground reaction forces) were collected while the Lenhart2015 subject performed overground walking at a self selected speed. 

Within COMAK it is important to define model coordinates as Primary, Secondary, and Prescribed. The Primary and the Prescribed coordinates must be quantifable using motion capture. In the COMAK optimization, a constraint equation is included for each Primary coordinate that dictates that the simulated accelerations (resulting from the model muscle, ligament, contact, external, gravitational, inertial forces) are equal to the measured accelerations of the Primary coordinates. In simpler terms, the model must generate the measured joint moments for the Primary coordinates. The Prescribed coordinates are prescribed within the simulation, thus their accelerations are generated by multibody constraints and not by the model forces. The Secondary coordinates generally cannot be accurately measured using motion capture and thus are predicted by the COMAK optimization.     

__Primary Coordinates__
- hip_flex_r
- hip_add_r
- hip_rotation_r
- knee_flex_r
- ankle_flex_r

__Secondary Coordinates__
- knee_add_r
- knee_rot_r
- knee_tx_r
- knee_ty_r
- knee_tz_r
- pf_flex_r
- pf_rot_r
- pf_tilt_r
- pf_tx_r
- pf_ty_r
- pf_tz_r

__Prescribed Coordinates__
- All other model coordinates (pelvis, left leg, upperbody). 

__COMAKInverseKinematicsTool__
The COMAKInverseKinematicsTool is used to calculate the kinematics of the Primary and Prescribed coordinates from the motion capture data. First, the COMAKInverseKinematics tool is used to perform a passive forward simulation where the knee flexion flexes from 0<sup>o<sup> to 120<sup>o<sup> and the Seconday coordinates are predicted based on the passive muscle, ligament, and articular contact forces. These simulation results are used to generate functions that couple the Secondary coordinates to the knee_flex_r within inverse kinematics through a CoordinateCouplerConstraint. These constraints are only used in the inverse kinematics solution and are removed for the COMAK simulation.
  
__COMAKTool__
The COMAKTool is used to calculate the Secondary kinematics, as well as the muscle, ligament, and articular contact forces for the measured walking trial. In this example

## Workflow Steps
1) Inspect the [./inputs/comak_inverse_kinematics_settings.xml](./inputs/comak_inverse_kinematics_settings.xml) and [./inputs/comak_settings.xml](./inputs/comak_settings.xml) files to understand the inputs and settings for the simulation.

2) Inspect the [run_walking.cmd](run_walking.cmd) file.

3) Double click on the [run_walking.cmd](run_walking.cmd) file to perform the simulation.

4) Visualize the results in Paraview.

5) Use MATLAB to run analyze_walking_results.m to generate plots of the simulation results.
