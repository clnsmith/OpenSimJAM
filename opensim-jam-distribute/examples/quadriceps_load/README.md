# Example: Quadriceps Load

This example demonstrates how to perform forward simulations with known muscle force, activation, and excitation patterns. 

excitation: vastus lateralis
activation: vastus intermedius 
force: vastus medialis

In the example, tibiofemoral flexion is prescribed. First it is set to zero for a settling period, then the knee is flexed and fixed at 30* after which the quadriceps muscle loads are ramped up.
